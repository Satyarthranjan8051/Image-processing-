# Image Noise Removal and Inverse Filtering

## AIM
Remove noise from images and apply inverse filtering.

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED
Any Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab)

## RELEVANCE OF THE EXPERIMENT
- **Image Quality Improvement**: Image noise removal is essential for enhancing the visual quality of images by reducing unwanted artifacts and distortions caused by noise.
- **Preprocessing Step**: Noise removal serves as a crucial preprocessing step in various image processing tasks, such as object detection, recognition, and classification.
- **Inverse Filtering**: Inverse filtering is used to recover the original image from the degraded version caused by blurring or other linear distortions, making it valuable for image restoration tasks.

## DESCRIPTION
- Image noise removal involves the application of filters or techniques to reduce or eliminate noise present in images. Common types of noise include Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and speckle noise. Inverse filtering, on the other hand, aims to recover the original image from a degraded version caused by blurring or other linear distortions. This experiment focuses on implementing techniques for both image noise removal and inverse filtering.

- Image noise removal is a crucial step in image processing that aims to enhance the quality of images by reducing or eliminating unwanted artifacts caused by noise. Noise can occur due to various factors such as electronic interference, sensor limitations, or transmission errors. Common types of noise include Gaussian noise, which is characterized by a bell-shaped distribution of intensity values; salt-and-pepper noise, which manifests as randomly occurring white and black pixels; and speckle noise, whi...

- To address the issue of noise, various filtering techniques are employed, including spatial filters such as median filtering, Gaussian filtering, and bilateral filtering. These filters operate directly on the pixel values of the image and are effective in smoothing out noise while preserving important image features.

- Inverse filtering, on the other hand, is employed to recover the original image from a degraded version caused by blurring or other linear distortions. When an image is degraded by blurring, for example, inverse filtering aims to reverse the blurring process and restore the sharpness and clarity of the original image. Inverse filtering is particularly useful in image restoration tasks where the degradation function is known or can be estimated.

- This experiment focuses on implementing techniques for both image noise removal and inverse filtering, providing learners with practical experience in preprocessing and restoring images. By understanding and applying these techniques, learners will gain valuable skills in image enhancement, restoration, and preprocessing, which are essential in various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing.

## PSEUDOCODE

```python
import cv2

# Load the input image
image = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

# Apply noise removal filter (e.g., median filter)
denoised_image = cv2.medianBlur(image, 5)

# Save or display the denoised image
cv2.imwrite('denoised_image.jpg', denoised_image)

# Inverse Filtering
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the degraded image
degraded_image = cv2.imread('degraded_image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply Fourier transform to the degraded image
degraded_fft = np.fft.fft2(degraded_image)

# Apply inverse filter in the frequency domain (assuming known degradation function and noise)
inverse_filter = np.conj(degraded_fft) / (degraded_fft * degradation_function + noise_spectrum)

# Perform inverse Fourier transform to obtain the restored image
restored_image = np.fft.ifft2(inverse_filter)

# Save or display the restored image
cv2.imwrite('restored_image.jpg', np.abs(restored_image))
```
