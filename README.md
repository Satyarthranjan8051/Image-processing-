Image Processing Techniques README
This repository contains Python code for applying various image processing techniques, including both frequency domain and spatial domain methods. The techniques covered are as follows:

<h3>Frequency Domain Techniques:</h3>
Low Pass Filter: Averages neighboring pixel values to reduce high-frequency noise.
High Pass Filter: Enhances edges and high-frequency components.
Band Pass Filter: Simulates a combination of low and high pass filters.
<h3>Spatial Domain Techniques: </h3>
Gaussian Filter: Smoothes the image using a weighted average of neighboring pixels.
Laplacian Filter (Sharpness Detection): Highlights areas of rapid intensity change (edges).
Sobel Edge Detection: Computes gradient magnitude in both x and y directions to find edges.
Usage
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries: numpy, matplotlib, and opencv-python.
Install the required libraries using:
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python

<h3>Running the Code:</h3>
Replace 'sample image4.jpeg' in the code with the actual path to your image file.
Execute the script to apply the specified filters and display the results.

<h3>Results:</h3>
The resulting images will be displayed using matplotlib.
You’ll see the original image, low pass filtered image, high pass filtered image, Gaussian filtered image, sharpness detection result (Laplacian), and Sobel edge detection result.
